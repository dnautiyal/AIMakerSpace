However, I can provide some general tips for writing effective loops in most programming languages:\n","\n","1. Understand the problem: Before writing a loop, make sure you have a clear understanding of the problem you are trying to solve and the conditions under which the loop should run.\n","\n","2. Choose the appropriate loop construct: Most programming languages offer different types of loops, such as \"for\" loops and \"while\" loops. Choose the loop construct that best fits your problem and the available information.\n","\n","3. Initialize loop variables: If using a \"for\" loop, ensure that the loop variable is initialized with the appropriate starting value. If using a \"while\" loop, initialize any loop-related variables outside the loop.\n","\n","4. Define the loop condition: Determine the condition under which the loop should continue running. For example, if iterating over a range of numbers, specify the desired range or condition to exit the loop.\n","\n","5. Update loop variables: Designate how the loop variable(s), if any, should be updated within the loop. This is usually done through an increment or decrement operation.\n","\n","6. Test loop condition: Check whether the loop condition remains true or false. If it is still true, the loop will continue to execute. If it becomes false, the loop will terminate.\n","\n","7. Handle loop body: Inside the loop, include the code that needs to be executed for each iteration. Ensure that the logic within the loop body is correct and implements the desired behavior.\n","\n","8. Exit the loop: If necessary, include a mechanism within the loop body to exit the loop prematurely based on certain conditions. This can be done using the \"break\" statement or similar constructs.\n","\n","9. Indentation and formatting: Maintain proper indentation and formatting to make the loop structure more readable and understandable. This helps with code maintenance and debugging.\n","\n","10. Test and debug: After writing the loop, thoroughly test it with different inputs and scenarios to ensure it behaves as expected. Debug any issues encountered during testing.\n","\n","Remember, the best approach to writing a loop will also depend on the specific requirements, constraints, and language conventions for your particular programming task.\n"]}],"source":["print(response)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"J2dKOQ7ipy9x"},"source":["### Retrieval Augmented Question Answering Prompt\n","\n","Now we can create a RAQA prompt - which will help our system behave in a way that makes sense!\n","\n","There is much you could do here, many tweaks and improvements to be made!"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"metadata":{"id":"BvEbWcAqpy9x","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1692202569766,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":261,"user":{"displayName":"Deepak Nautiyal","userId":"17947820754524156544"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["RAQA_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = \"\"\"\n","Use the provided context to answer the user's query.\n","\n","You may not answer the user's query unless there is specific context in the following text.\n","\n","If you do not know the answer, or cannot answer, please respond with \"I don't know\".\n","\n","Context:\n","{context}\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","raqa_prompt = SystemRolePrompt(RAQA_PROMPT_TEMPLATE)\n","\n","USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = \"\"\"\n","User Query:\n","{user_query}\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","user_prompt = UserRolePrompt(USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE)\n","\n","class RetrievalAugmentedQAPipeline:\n","    def __init__(self, llm: ChatOpenAI(), vector_db_retriever: VectorDatabase) -> None:\n","        self.llm = llm\n","        self.vector_db_retriever = vector_db_retriever\n","\n","    def run_pipeline(self, user_query: str) -> str:\n","        context_list = self.vector_db_retriever.search_by_text(user_query, k=4)\n","\n","        context_prompt = \"\"\n","        for context in context_list:\n","            context_prompt += context[0] + \"\\n\"\n","\n","        formatted_system_prompt = raqa_prompt.create_message(context=context_prompt)\n","\n","        formatted_user_prompt = user_prompt.create_message(user_query=user_query)\n","\n","        return self.llm.run([formatted_system_prompt, formatted_user_prompt])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{"id":"seZCGD8Wpy9y","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1692202572933,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":281,"user":{"displayName":"Deepak Nautiyal","userId":"17947820754524156544"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["retrieval_augmented_qa_pipeline = RetrievalAugmentedQAPipeline(\n","    vector_db_retriever=vector_db,\n","    llm=chat_openai\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{"id":"NHEFPkftpy9y","outputId":"3b133af7-1d16-4eaa-ebf7-f8dfd4e6c6cf","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":87},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1692202578916,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":4006,"user":{"displayName":"Deepak Nautiyal","userId":"17947820754524156544"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'King Lear is a character in William Shakespeare\\'s play \"King Lear.\" He is the king of Britain and the father of three daughters, Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia.
